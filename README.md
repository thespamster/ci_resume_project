# resume-project

A guided project through code institute to create an online cv.

I am using this project to get to grips with HTML, CSS, Linux terminal commands for Github and Github itself.
So far so good.

I have changed the file structure of the project to allow it to display using Github Pages.

I have used the terminal commands to update the repo, improving my familiarity with these commands/processes.

I have also updated this readme file so I become more accustomed to adding clear and concise notes.
